# TCF Mock Interview Guide
This is the guideline for how to conduct mock technical interviews with TCFs who are entering the job market. The purpose of the mock interview is to give TCFs some interview practice and to provide feedback to TCFs to help them ace their interviews. 

## Logistics 

You'll be connected with your mock interviewee and together you can schedule a time to conduct the (remote) technical interview on Zoom. 

At the beginning of the interview, you can share the prompt via this GitHub repo. As your interviewee to share their screen and get started! 

Each mock interview session should last one hour. You should spend roughly 45 minutes on the interview portion and 15 minutes providing feedback. 

*Note on recordings: We'd love to record mock interviews to provide resources to TCFs and students. Ask your interviewee if they are comfortable recording the mock interview + feedback session and use Zoom to record if so. Upload your video to YouTube and mark it as "unlisted". Then, share it in the #student-council Slack channel and Sophie and Niky will make sure it ends up in the right place.*

## Conducting the Interview

Provide your interviewee with the prompt and give them some time to read through it and ask initial questions. Approach the interview session similarly to how you would approach pair programming--you're colloborating with the interviewee to solve a problem and you want to find out what its like to work with this person, as well as assess their technical skills. Answer questions where you feel appropriate and feel free to decline giving away certain pieces of information. 

Wrap up the interview portion at about the 45 minute mark, whether or not the interviewee had coded a complete solution. Take a minute or two to gather your thoughts for feedback and spend the remainder of your time providing feedback. Leave time for the interviewee to ask you questions about the technical interview process. 

## Interview Rubric

Use the following rubric to inform your assessment of the candidate.

 ## Feedback Session
 
Clearly explain your assessment of the candidate on the basis of the guidelines above. Offer *constructive feedback*. If someone rated a "strong no", "no" or "mixed" assessment, explain what they can work on to improve in that area. Overall, be supportive and positive. Save time for your interviewee to ask you questions.
